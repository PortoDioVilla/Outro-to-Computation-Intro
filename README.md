# Outro-to-Computation-Intro
I made a big mistake learning set theory before taking Intro to Computation. It's too late to seek enrichment elsewhere; it must come from me.

I intend to upload proofs I have devised about the Theory of Computation as they pertain to CSC236, an undergrauate course at the University of Toronto. I create these proofs only to try and maintain some semblance of sanity, but I freely offer them. I expect that the entirety of what I post here will be derivative work, but I do it anyway to bridge the gap between the right way of things (more math) and the current state of affairs (less math)
